Words Game - ExtraCredit Problem
Word puzzle invented in the 19th century by Lewis Carroll. For this game, there will be assigned a starting word and a target word. At each step of the game, you must change a single letter of the word, such that you transform it into another existing word (it is forbidden to transform a word into a non-word). 
For example, if the starting word is SAME and the target word is COST, one solution would be the following:
SAME
CAME
CASE
CAST
COST
